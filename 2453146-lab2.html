        <h2> About me</h2>
        My name is Jordan, and I am a computer science student who is in his final year of undergraduate studies, at Wits University of wits. I am the youngest of 4 siblings, one of which attended Wits University and acquired a hard-fought engineering degree. After having completed this degree, I have hopes of doing my honors, after which I hope to become a data scientist, and perhaps a quantatative analyst.

        <h3> Latest Project</h3>
        The latest project I am working on is an app which will help people of all ages with their productivity. It will allow people to hold one another accountable, through things such as notifications and a to-do list.
